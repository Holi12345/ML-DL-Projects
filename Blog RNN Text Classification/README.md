# Text Classification with RNNs

This project is my attempt at text classification by first creating a language model, then fine tuning that language model to the task of
text classification. Unfortunately I found my hardware was unable to sufficiently train the model in a reasonable amount of time. Even with
compromises on limiting the scope of the corpus trained on and reducing parameters in the model, this was still a beast to train. And after
all that training, the model didn't even perform well! My poor GPU's efforts - all in vain. Despite all this I had fun with the project. I'll
take this one as a learning experience.
